# Fathym Atomic Design Kit

The Fathym Atomic Design Kit is a base atomic library that is designed to be
composed into domain-specific component libraries. This approach allows for a
high degree of modularity and reusability in your UI development.

To effectively use this library, we recommend following Brad Frost's Atomic
Design Principles. These principles provide a methodology for creating design
systems that are easy to understand, scalable, and powerful. They involve
breaking down your UI into its most basic components (or 'atoms'), and combining
these atoms to form more complex 'molecules' and 'organisms'.

You can learn more about Atomic Design Principles here:
[Atomic Design Principals](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)

By adhering to these principles, you can ensure that your UI is consistent,
maintainable, and adaptable to a wide range of use cases.
